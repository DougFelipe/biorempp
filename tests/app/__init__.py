"""
Test package for the biorempp.app module.

This package contains comprehensive test suites for the BioRemPP application
layer components, including the main application orchestrator, command factory,
and their integration patterns.

Test Coverage
------------
- BioRemPPApplication: Main application orchestrator testing
- CommandFactory: Command pattern and factory implementation testing
- Integration testing between application components
- Error handling and exception management testing
- Dependency injection and component lifecycle testing

Test Organization
----------------
The tests are organized by component and functionality:

test_application.py:
    - Application initialization and configuration
    - Main execution flow and orchestration
    - Error handling and exception management
    - Dependency injection testing
    - Version and metadata management

test_command_factory.py:
    - Command creation and routing logic
    - Argument validation and processing
    - Command type detection and inspection
    - Factory pattern implementation testing

Testing Strategy
---------------
- Unit tests for individual component behavior
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Performance and edge case validation

Dependencies
-----------
- pytest: Primary testing framework
- unittest.mock: Mocking and patching capabilities
- pytest fixtures: Shared test data and configuration
- Standard library testing utilities

Example Usage
------------
    # Run all app tests
    pytest tests/app/ -v

    # Run specific test module
    pytest tests/app/test_application.py -v

    # Run with coverage
    pytest tests/app/ --cov=biorempp.app --cov-report=term-missing

Technical Notes
--------------
- All tests follow PEP 8 and flake8 compliance with <88 character lines
- English documentation and comments throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings for all test classes and methods
- Mock-based testing to isolate component behavior
- Fixtures for consistent test data and configuration
