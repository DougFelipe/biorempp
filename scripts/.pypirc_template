# ============================================================================
# USAGE EXAMPLES:
# ============================================================================
#
# Upload to TestPyPI (recommended for testing):
# twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
#
# Upload to PyPI (production):
# twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
# or simply:
# twine upload dist/*
#
# Install from TestPyPI for testing:
# pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ biorempp
#
# ============================================================================
# SECURITY NOTES:
# ============================================================================
# - This file contains sensitive authentication tokens
# - Never commit this file to git or share it publicly
# - Use project-specific tokens when possible (after first upload)
# - Set appropriate file permissions (chmod 600 on Unix systems)
# - Regularly rotate your tokens for security
#
# ============================================================================
# TOKEN SCOPES:
# ============================================================================
# For first-time uploads, use "Entire account" scope
# After successful upload, consider creating project-specific tokens:
# - Scope: "Specific project" 
# - Project: biorempp
# This provides better security by limiting token permissions
